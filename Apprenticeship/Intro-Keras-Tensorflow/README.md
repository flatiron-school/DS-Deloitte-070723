# Introduction to Keras and Tensorflow

The lesson culminates in coding up a first ANN in `keras`, but first there are some loose ends to tie up regarding backpropagation, batches, and optimizers.

## Learning Goals

- Describe the concept of backpropagation
- Explain the use of gradient descent in neural networks
- Use `keras` to code up a neural network model

## Lesson Materials

Two notebooks:
- [Jupyter Notebook: Intro to Keras and Tensorflow](intro_to_keras_and_tf.ipynb)
- [Jupyter Notebook: Neural Network from Scratch](neural_network_from_scratch.ipynb)
