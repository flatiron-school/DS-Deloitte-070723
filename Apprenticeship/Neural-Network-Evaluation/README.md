# Network Regularization and Evaluation

Exploring the options available in `keras` for coding up densely connected NNs.

## Learning Goals

- Use `keras` to code up a neural network model
- Explain dropout and early stopping as distinctive forms of regularization in neural networks
- Use wrappers inside `keras` to make models that can jibe with `sklearn`

## Lesson Materials
